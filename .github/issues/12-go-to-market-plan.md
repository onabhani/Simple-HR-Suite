## Problem

The plugin is ready for commercialization but needs a structured plan for selling it.

## Tasks

- [ ] Research competing WordPress HR plugins (WP ERP, OrangeHRM WP, Jejewe HR) — pricing, features, market positioning
- [ ] Define a pricing model (freemium with pro add-ons, flat license, per-employee pricing)
- [ ] Set up a product landing page
- [ ] Create demo environment for potential buyers
- [ ] Write marketing copy highlighting unique features (modular design, PWA support, multi-language, etc.)
- [ ] List on WordPress plugin marketplaces (CodeCanyon/Envato, WordPress.org for free tier)
- [ ] Set up license key management and update delivery system
- [ ] Plan support channels (documentation, email, community forum)

## Key Considerations

- The plugin has strong differentiators: 17 modules, PWA support, 4 languages, modular architecture
- Freemium model could drive adoption (free core + paid modules)
- CodeCanyon average pricing for HR plugins: $39-$79 for regular license

## Priority

P4 — Strategic
