## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- False early leave requests when employee clocks out on time or after shift end (0-minute flags)
- Total-hours mode incorrectly using irrelevant shift end time for early leave detection (e.g. 292-minute false positives)

### Added

- GitHub issue templates for all planned enhancements (.github/issues/)
- Early leave request permissions: Admin sees all, department managers see only their department
- Only GM or department manager can approve/reject early leave requests
- 72-hour auto-reject cron for unactioned early leave requests (Early_Leave_Auto_Reject)
- Early leave requests card on HR dashboard (scoped by department)
- One-time cleanup migration to remove false early leave records created by pre-fix code
- GitHub Updater headers for automatic plugin updates from GitHub

### Changed
- Early leave review modal replaced with slide-up bottom sheet for consistency
- Attendance policies tab made responsive (breakpoints at 1024px and 782px)
